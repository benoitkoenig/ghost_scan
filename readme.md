# Usage

- To generate a picture of a printed document: `./generate_pictures_of_printed_image.sh`
- To convert all pdfs in data/pdf into images and save them in data/png/ (erases the pdfs): `./convert_pdf_to_png.sh`
- To create the gradient map: `python create_gradient_map.py`. Since the gradient map is pushed to the repository, this is only useful if you need to change gradient.png
