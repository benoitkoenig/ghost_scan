# Usage

- To generate a picture of a printed document: `blender -b -P generate_picture_of_printed_image.py`
- To convert all pdfs in data/pdf into images and save them in data/png/ (erases the pdfs): `python convert_pdf_to_png.py`
- To create the gradient map: `python create_gradient_map.py`. Since the gradient map is pushed to the repository, this is only useful if you need to change gradient.png
